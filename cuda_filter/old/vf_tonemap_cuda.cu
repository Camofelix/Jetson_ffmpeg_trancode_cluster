/*NOTICE: this is a test build based on the initial works of the NVIDIA Corporation to create an FF>
tonemapping filter. 
This filter will take in a source file that is presumed to be HDR (probably p010) 
and convert it to an aproximation of the source content within the SDR/ Rec.709 colour space 

Initially this will be done with the hable filter, as it is easier to implement and relatively simp>


Over time I hope to use the BT.2390-8 EOTF, but that is beyond the scope of the initial build

//This is the cuda side. it handles all of the math.

void add(float pix, int x, int y )// what do we need? we need a pointer to an array, call it source, and we need 2 integers, the width and the height
{

		// pix is a 2d array of width x and height y. therefore, to work on a given pixel, we adress it first by it's collum, then by it's row. 

		//to optimize this, we'll spin the threads into blocks of {[ceiling] x/32} width, which then get spun off into threads for each block. This can be optimized down the line
